# Policy vs Detail

The concept of "Policy vs. Detail" is a design principle that emphasizes the separation of high-level policies from low-level implementation details in software architecture. This separation enhances the maintainability, flexibility, and scalability of a system by ensuring that high-level decisions are not tightly coupled with low-level implementations.

# Key Concepts

1. **Policy**

**Intent**: Represents the high-level rules, strategies, or goals that guide the overall behavior and design of the system. Policies are abstract and should be stable, reflecting the core business logic and requirements.

**Example**:

- Business rules, such as "a user must be authenticated to access certain resources."
- Application logic, such as "calculate discounts based on user membership level."

2. **Detail**

**Intent**: Refers to the low-level implementation specifics that achieve the policies. Details can change over time without affecting the high-level policies.

**Example**:

- Specific authentication mechanism, such as OAuth2 or JWT tokens.
- Discount calculation algorithm, such as using a specific formula or accessing a database.

# Benefits of Policy vs. Detail Separation

1. **Maintainability**: Changes in low-level details do not affect the high-level policies, making the system easier to maintain.
2. **Flexibility**: Different implementations can be swapped in and out without changing the core business logic.
3. **Scalability**: High-level policies can guide the scaling decisions independently of the implementation details.
4. **Testability**: High-level policies can be tested in isolation from the low-level details.

# Examples in TypeScript

**Policy vs. Detail Example**

Consider an e-commerce application where users must be authenticated to place orders. The high-level policy is the authentication requirement, while the specific authentication mechanism is a detail.

```typescript
// High-level policy interface
interface AuthPolicy {
  isAuthenticated(): boolean;
}

// Low-level detail: OAuth2 authentication
class OAuth2Auth implements AuthPolicy {
  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Implementation of OAuth2 authentication check
    return true; // Simulate an authenticated user
  }
}

// Low-level detail: JWT authentication
class JWTAuth implements AuthPolicy {
  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Implementation of JWT authentication check
    return true; // Simulate an authenticated user
  }
}

// OrderService uses the high-level policy interface
class OrderService {
  private authPolicy: AuthPolicy;

  constructor(authPolicy: AuthPolicy) {
    this.authPolicy = authPolicy;
  }

  public placeOrder(order: string): void {
    if (this.authPolicy.isAuthenticated()) {
      console.log(`Order placed: ${order}`);
    } else {
      console.log("User not authenticated. Cannot place order.");
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const oauthAuth = new OAuth2Auth();
const jwtAuth = new JWTAuth();

const orderService1 = new OrderService(oauthAuth);
orderService1.placeOrder("Order 1"); // Output: Order placed: Order 1

const orderService2 = new OrderService(jwtAuth);
orderService2.placeOrder("Order 2"); // Output: Order placed: Order 2
```

# Real-Life Analogy

**Policy**: Company policy requiring employees to work 8 hours a day.

- Detail: The specific tools and methods used to track work hours (e.g., punch cards, digital time tracking software).
  By separating the high-level policy (work hours requirement) from the low-level details (time tracking methods), the company can easily switch from one time tracking system to another without changing the core requirement.

# Summary

The "Policy vs. Detail" principle is a fundamental design guideline that helps in creating flexible and maintainable software systems by clearly separating the high-level policies from the low-level implementation details. This separation allows for easier maintenance, improved flexibility, and better scalability.
