# Boundaries

**Boundaries** in software design refer to the interfaces and limits between different parts of a system. These boundaries are crucial for maintaining a well-structured and maintainable codebase. They help in separating concerns, managing dependencies, and ensuring that changes in one part of the system do not have unintended effects on other parts.

# Key Concepts of Boundaries

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Dividing a software system into distinct sections, each of which addresses a separate concern or functionality. This makes the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

2. **Interfaces**: Clearly defined points of interaction between different parts of the system. Interfaces ensure that different modules or components can communicate with each other without being tightly coupled.

3. **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal details of a module or component and exposing only the necessary interfaces. This reduces the impact of changes in the implementation details on the rest of the system.

4. **Dependency Management**: Managing how different parts of the system depend on each other. By controlling dependencies, we can reduce the risk of cascading changes and improve the modularity of the system.

# Benefits of Defining Boundaries

1. **Modularity**: By defining clear boundaries, we create modular components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
2. **Flexibility**: Boundaries allow different parts of the system to be replaced or upgraded with minimal impact on other parts.
3. **Scalability**: Well-defined boundaries make it easier to scale different parts of the system independently.
4. **Maintainability**: Code becomes easier to understand, debug, and modify when boundaries are clear.

# Examples in TypeScript

**Example 1: Separation of Concerns**

```typescript
// UserService handles user-related operations
class UserService {
  getUser(id: number): string {
    return `User with ID: ${id}`;
  }
}

// ProductService handles product-related operations
class ProductService {
  getProduct(id: number): string {
    return `Product with ID: ${id}`;
  }
}

// OrderService interacts with both UserService and ProductService
class OrderService {
  private userService: UserService;
  private productService: ProductService;

  constructor(userService: UserService, productService: ProductService) {
    this.userService = userService;
    this.productService = productService;
  }

  placeOrder(userId: number, productId: number): string {
    const user = this.userService.getUser(userId);
    const product = this.productService.getProduct(productId);
    return `${user} ordered ${product}`;
  }
}

const userService = new UserService();
const productService = new ProductService();
const orderService = new OrderService(userService, productService);

console.log(orderService.placeOrder(1, 101)); // Output: User with ID: 1 ordered Product with ID: 101
```

**Example 2: Interfaces and Encapsulation**

```typescript
// PaymentGateway interface defines the contract
interface PaymentGateway {
  processPayment(amount: number): boolean;
}

// StripePayment implements the PaymentGateway interface
class StripePayment implements PaymentGateway {
  processPayment(amount: number): boolean {
    console.log(`Processing payment of ${amount} via Stripe.`);
    return true;
  }
}

// PayPalPayment implements the PaymentGateway interface
class PayPalPayment implements PaymentGateway {
  processPayment(amount: number): boolean {
    console.log(`Processing payment of ${amount} via PayPal.`);
    return true;
  }
}

// PaymentService uses the PaymentGateway interface
class PaymentService {
  private paymentGateway: PaymentGateway;

  constructor(paymentGateway: PaymentGateway) {
    this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
  }

  makePayment(amount: number): void {
    if (this.paymentGateway.processPayment(amount)) {
      console.log("Payment successful.");
    } else {
      console.log("Payment failed.");
    }
  }
}

const stripePayment = new StripePayment();
const paymentService = new PaymentService(stripePayment);
paymentService.makePayment(100); // Output: Processing payment of 100 via Stripe. Payment successful.
```

# Real-Life Analogy

**Boundaries in a House**: Consider a house with different rooms, each designed for a specific purpose (kitchen, bedroom, bathroom). The boundaries (walls) between rooms allow each room to serve its function independently. For example, activities in the kitchen (cooking) do not interfere with activities in the bedroom (sleeping). Similarly, the interfaces (doors) between rooms allow interaction (moving from one room to another) without disrupting the function of each room.

# Summary

Defining boundaries in software design is essential for creating modular, flexible, and maintainable systems. By separating concerns, managing dependencies, and encapsulating details, boundaries help ensure that changes in one part of the system do not negatively impact other parts. This leads to a more robust and scalable architecture.
