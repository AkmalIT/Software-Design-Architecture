# Identity Maps

**Identity Maps** are a design pattern used in enterprise applications to manage and track objects retrieved from a database to ensure that each object is loaded only once per session. This pattern helps to prevent redundant database queries and maintains consistency by ensuring that modifications to an object are reflected across all references to that object.

# Key Characteristics of Identity Maps

1. **Caching**:

- Stores objects in a cache to avoid repeated database access for the same object.

2. **Uniqueness**:

- Ensures that each object is loaded only once per session, preventing duplicate instances of the same object.

3. **Tracking Changes**:

- Helps track changes to objects, making it easier to implement patterns like Unit of Work for committing changes.

4. **Session Scope**:

- The identity map is typically scoped to a session, meaning it is cleared or reset after a session ends.

# Benefits of Using Identity Maps

1. **Performance Optimization**:

- Reduces the number of database queries by caching objects, leading to improved performance.

2. **Consistency**:

- Ensures that changes to an object are reflected across all references to that object within the session.

3. **Simplifies Object Relationships**:

- Makes it easier to manage relationships between objects since the same instance is always used.

4. **Improved Concurrency**:

- Reduces the likelihood of conflicting updates by ensuring a single instance of each object per session.

# Challenges of Using Identity Maps

1. **Memory Overhead**:

- Storing objects in memory can consume significant resources, especially for large datasets.

2. **Complexity**:

- Adds complexity to the codebase by requiring mechanisms to manage the identity map and its lifecycle.

3. **Synchronization Issues**:

- Keeping the identity map synchronized with the database can be challenging, especially in distributed systems.

# Example of Identity Maps in TypeScript

Consider a simple scenario where an identity map is used to manage user objects retrieved from a database.

1. **Defining the Identity Map**:

```typescript
class IdentityMap<T> {
  private map: Map<string, T> = new Map();

  get(id: string): T | undefined {
    return this.map.get(id);
  }

  add(id: string, entity: T): void {
    this.map.set(id, entity);
  }

  clear(): void {
    this.map.clear();
  }
}
```

2. **Domain Model**:

```typescript
class User {
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string, public email: string) {}
}
```

3. **User Repository with Identity Map**:

```typescript
class UserRepository {
  private identityMap: IdentityMap<User> = new IdentityMap();

  async findById(id: string): Promise<User | undefined> {
    // Check the identity map first
    let user = this.identityMap.get(id);
    if (user) {
      return user;
    }

    // Simulate fetching a user from a database
    user = await this.fetchFromDatabase(id);
    if (user) {
      this.identityMap.add(id, user);
    }
    return user;
  }

  private async fetchFromDatabase(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // Simulate a database call
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(new User(id, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com"));
      }, 100);
    });
  }
}
```

4. **Usage Example**:

```typescript
(async () => {
  const userRepository = new UserRepository();

  // First call, fetches from the database
  let user = await userRepository.findById("123");
  console.log(user); // Output: User { id: '123', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' }

  // Second call, fetches from the identity map
  user = await userRepository.findById("123");
  console.log(user); // Output: User { id: '123', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' }
})();
```

# Real-Life Analogy

**Library System**:

Imagine a library system where each book has a unique identifier. When a book is checked out, the system keeps track of which book is with which member. If another member tries to check out the same book, the system references the existing record rather than creating a new one. This ensures that each book is managed consistently and avoids duplicate records.

# Summary

**Identity Maps** are a powerful design pattern for managing and tracking objects within a session. They help optimize performance by reducing redundant database access, maintain consistency by ensuring a single instance per object, and simplify the management of object relationships. While they introduce some complexity and memory overhead, their benefits make them valuable in enterprise applications where performance and consistency are critical.
