# Domain Models

**Domain Models** are a crucial part of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), representing the conceptual model of a particular domain that captures its logic and rules. A domain model defines the entities, value objects, aggregates, and services that work together to solve business problems. It serves as a bridge between the business requirements and the technical implementation, ensuring that the software reflects the real-world scenarios it is intended to address.

# Key Characteristics of Domain Models

1. **Entities**:

- Objects that have a distinct identity and lifecycle. Examples include Customer, Order, and Product.

2. **Value Objects**:

- Objects that are defined by their attributes rather than a unique identity. They are immutable and can be compared based on their state. Examples include Money, Address, and DateRange.

3. **Aggregates**:

- Clusters of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes. Each aggregate has a root entity, which ensures consistency within the aggregate. Examples include Order with its OrderItems.

4. **Services**:

- Operations that do not naturally belong to an entity or value object but are part of the domain logic. Examples include PaymentProcessingService and ShippingService.

5. **Repositories**:

- Mechanisms for accessing and storing aggregates. They abstract the data layer, allowing the domain model to remain independent of the underlying database technology.

# Benefits of Domain Models

1. **Alignment with Business**:

- Ensures that the software accurately reflects the business requirements and rules.

2. **Clarity**:

- Provides a clear and organized structure for understanding and working with the domain.

3. **Maintainability**:

- Facilitates easier maintenance and evolution of the system as business needs change.

4. **Communication**:

- Improves communication between developers and domain experts by using a common language.

# Example of Domain Models in TypeScript

Consider an example where we model an e-commerce system with Customer, Order, and Product entities.

1. **Defining the Entities**:

```typescript
class Product {
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string, public price: number) {}
}

class Customer {
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string, public email: string) {}
}

class OrderItem {
  constructor(public product: Product, public quantity: number) {}

  getTotalPrice(): number {
    return this.product.price * this.quantity;
  }
}

class Order {
  private items: OrderItem[] = [];

  constructor(public id: string, public customer: Customer) {}

  addItem(product: Product, quantity: number): void {
    const item = new OrderItem(product, quantity);
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  getTotal(): number {
    return this.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.getTotalPrice(), 0);
  }
}
```

2. **Using Repositories**:

```typescript
class OrderRepository {
  private orders: Map<string, Order> = new Map();

  save(order: Order): void {
    this.orders.set(order.id, order);
  }

  findById(orderId: string): Order | undefined {
    return this.orders.get(orderId);
  }
}

class CustomerRepository {
  private customers: Map<string, Customer> = new Map();

  save(customer: Customer): void {
    this.customers.set(customer.id, customer);
  }

  findById(customerId: string): Customer | undefined {
    return this.customers.get(customerId);
  }
}
```

3. **Example Usage**:

```typescript
const customerRepo = new CustomerRepository();
const orderRepo = new OrderRepository();

const customer = new Customer("1", "John Doe", "john@example.com");
customerRepo.save(customer);

const product = new Product("1", "Laptop", 1000);
const order = new Order("1", customer);
order.addItem(product, 2);

orderRepo.save(order);

const savedOrder = orderRepo.findById("1");
if (savedOrder) {
  console.log(`Total order price: ${savedOrder.getTotal()}`); // Output: Total order price: 2000
}
```

# Real-Life Analogy

**Construction Project**:

Imagine a construction project for building a house. The domain model would include entities like House, Room, and Material, value objects like Dimensions and Cost, and services like ConstructionService and InspectionService. Each part has its specific role and responsibilities, contributing to the successful completion of the project.

# Summary

**Domain Models** are essential for accurately representing the business logic and rules within software. By organizing the system into entities, value objects, aggregates, and services, domain models ensure that the software closely aligns with the business requirements. This alignment not only improves clarity and maintainability but also facilitates better communication between developers and domain experts.
