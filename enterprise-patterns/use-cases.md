# Use Cases

**Use Cases** describe the functional requirements of a system from the user's perspective. They specify the interactions between the system and its users (actors) to achieve specific goals. Use cases are a fundamental aspect of software development, particularly in requirements engineering, as they help ensure that the system meets the needs of its users.

# Key Characteristics of Use Cases

1. **User-Centric**:

- Focuses on what the user needs to achieve rather than how the system achieves it.

2. **Actors**:

- Defines the roles of users or other systems that interact with the system.

3. **Goals**:

- Specifies the goals or objectives that the actors aim to achieve with the system.

4. **Scenarios**:

- Describes the step-by-step interactions between the actors and the system to accomplish a goal.

5. **Preconditions and Postconditions**:

- **Preconditions**: States the conditions that must be true before the use case starts.
- **Postconditions**: States the conditions that will be true after the use case completes.

6. **Main Success Scenario**:

- The primary flow where everything proceeds as expected.

7. **Extensions/Alternate Flows**:

- Variations or exceptions to the main success scenario.

# Benefits of Using Use Cases

1. **Clear Requirements**:

- Provides a clear and structured way to capture and communicate requirements.

2. **User Focus**:

- Ensures that the system's design and implementation are driven by user needs and goals.

3. **Communication**:

- Facilitates communication among stakeholders, including developers, testers, and business analysts.

4. **Validation and Verification**:

- Helps in validating and verifying that the system meets the specified requirements.

5. **Traceability**:

- Provides traceability from requirements to design, implementation, and testing.

# Challenges of Using Use Cases

1. **Detail Level**:

- Determining the appropriate level of detail can be challenging; too much detail can overwhelm, while too little can leave gaps.

2. **Maintenance**:

- Keeping use cases up to date with changes in requirements can be time-consuming.

3. **Complexity**:

- For large systems, managing a large number of use cases can become complex.

# Example of Use Cases in a Library System

Consider a simple library management system with use cases for borrowing books, returning books, and searching for books.

1. **Actors**:

- **Member**: A user who borrows and returns books.
- **Librarian**: A user who manages the library system.
- **System**: The library management system itself.

2. **Use Case: Borrow Book**

- **Goal**: Member borrows a book from the library.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1. Member searches for a book.
2. System displays search results.
3. Member selects a book to borrow.
4. System checks book availability.
5. System records the borrowing transaction.
6. System updates the inventory.
7. Member receives confirmation.

**Extensions**:

- If the book is not available, system notifies the member and suggests alternative options.

3. **Use Case: Return Book**

- **Goal**: Member returns a borrowed book to the library.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1. Member initiates a return.
2. System records the return transaction.
3. System updates the inventory.
4. Member receives confirmation.

**Extensions**:

- If the book is damaged, system notifies the librarian for further action.

4. **Use Case: Search Book**

- **Goal**: Member or librarian searches for books in the library catalog.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1. User enters search criteria.
2. System searches the catalog.
3. System displays search results.

**Extensions**:

- If no books match the search criteria, system notifies the user.

# Real-Life Analogy

**Restaurant Menu**:

Think of use cases like a restaurant menu. The menu (use case) outlines what dishes (goals) are available to customers (actors) and how they can order (interactions). The steps a waiter takes to serve food, from taking an order to delivering the dish, represent the scenarios. Alternate flows include handling out-of-stock items or special requests.

# Summary

**Use Cases** are a valuable tool in software development for capturing and communicating functional requirements from the user's perspective. They focus on the interactions between the system and its users to achieve specific goals, providing a clear and structured approach to defining what the system should do. Despite some challenges, use cases offer significant benefits in ensuring that the system meets user needs and facilitates effective communication among stakeholders.
