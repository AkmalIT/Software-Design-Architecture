# Mappers

**Mappers** are components used to transform data from one format or structure to another. They are commonly used in software development to convert data between different layers of an application, such as converting domain models to data transfer objects (DTOs) and vice versa. Mappers help maintain a clean separation of concerns and improve the maintainability and readability of the code.

# Key Characteristics of Mappers

1. **Transformation**:

- Convert data from one format or structure to another.

2. **Decoupling**:

- Decouple different parts of the system by handling the transformation logic, allowing each part to work with its preferred data structure.

3. **Reusability**:

- Centralize transformation logic in one place, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.

4. **Consistency**:

- Ensure consistent data transformation across the application.

# Benefits of Using Mappers

1. **Separation of Concerns**:

- Keeps the business logic and data transformation logic separate, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

2. **Maintainability**:

- Makes it easier to update and modify data transformations in a single place.

3. **Testability**:

- Simplifies testing by isolating data transformation logic in mappers.

4. **Consistency**:

- Ensures that data transformation is handled uniformly across the application.

# Challenges of Using Mappers

1. **Performance Overhead**:

- Can introduce performance overhead if not implemented efficiently, especially for large data sets.

2. **Complexity**:

- May add complexity to the codebase, particularly if the transformation logic is intricate.

# Example of Mappers in TypeScript

Consider a scenario where we have a User domain model and a UserDTO. We will create a mapper to convert between these two.

1. **Defining the User Model and UserDTO**:

```typescript
class User {
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string, public email: string) {}
}

interface UserDTO {
  id: string;
  fullName: string;
  emailAddress: string;
}
```

2. **Implementing the UserMapper**:

```typescript
class UserMapper {
  static toDTO(user: User): UserDTO {
    return {
      id: user.id,
      fullName: user.name,
      emailAddress: user.email,
    };
  }

  static toDomain(userDTO: UserDTO): User {
    return new User(userDTO.id, userDTO.fullName, userDTO.emailAddress);
  }
}
```

3. **Usage Example**:

```typescript
const user = new User("1", "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");

// Convert User to UserDTO
const userDTO = UserMapper.toDTO(user);
console.log(userDTO);
// Output: { id: '1', fullName: 'John Doe', emailAddress: 'john.doe@example.com' }

// Convert UserDTO back to User
const newUser = UserMapper.toDomain(userDTO);
console.log(newUser);
// Output: User { id: '1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' }
```

# Real-Life Analogy

**Translator**:

Imagine a translator who converts a book written in one language to another language. The translator ensures that the meaning, context, and nuances are preserved during the translation process. In a similar way, mappers translate data between different formats while preserving its meaning and structure.

# Summary

**Mappers** play a crucial role in transforming data between different layers or components of an application. They help decouple different parts of the system, promote code reuse, and ensure consistent data transformation. Despite some potential performance overhead, the benefits of using mappers for maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase are significant.
