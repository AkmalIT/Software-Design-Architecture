## Architectural Patterns

This section covers various architectural patterns used in software engineering to provide solutions to common problems in system architecture.

- **Contents:**
  - Definition and benefits
  - Examples
  - Best practices

## Architectural Principles

Architectural principles are fundamental guidelines for building robust and scalable systems.

- **Contents:**
  - Core principles
  - Real-world examples
  - Implementation strategies

## Architectural Styles

Architectural styles define the overall structure for software systems.

- **Contents:**
  - Overview of different styles
  - Use cases
  - Pros and cons

## Clean Code Principles

Clean code principles help ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and free from bugs.

- **Contents:**
  - Key principles (e.g., DRY, KISS, YAGNI)
  - Guidelines for writing clean code
  - Code examples

## Design Patterns

Design patterns provide general solutions to recurring design problems.

- **Contents:**
  - Creational patterns
  - Structural patterns
  - Behavioral patterns

## Design Principles

Design principles guide the creation of software that is both functional and maintainable.

- **Contents:**
  - SOLID principles
  - Other essential design principles
  - Code examples

## Enterprise Patterns

Enterprise patterns address common challenges in enterprise software development.

- **Contents:**
  - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
  - Repositories
  - Identity Maps
  - Use cases

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

- **Contents:**
  - Core concepts (e.g., inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
  - Abstract and concrete classes
  - Interfaces and domain models
  - Code examples in TypeScript

## Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms define different approaches to programming.

- **Contents:**
  - Overview of paradigms (e.g., structured, declarative, event-driven)
  - Examples in JavaScript and TypeScript
  - Real-life analogies
