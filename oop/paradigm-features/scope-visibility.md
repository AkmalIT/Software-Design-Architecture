# Scope Visibility

In TypeScript, you can use access modifiers directly within class definitions to control the visibility and accessibility of class members. Hereâ€™s how you can use public, private, and protected in TypeScript.

# Public Members

Public members are accessible from anywhere. This is the default visibility in TypeScript if no access modifier is specified.

```typescript
class Person {
  public name: string; // public by default
  public age: number; // public by default

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public greet(): void {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  }
}

const person = new Person("Alice", 30);
person.greet(); // Accessible, Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
console.log(person.name); // Accessible
console.log(person.age); // Accessible
```

# Private Members

Private members are only accessible within the class they are declared in.

```typescript
class Person {
  private name: string;
  private age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public greet(): void {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  }
}

const person = new Person("Bob", 40);
person.greet(); // Accessible, Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 40 years old.
// console.log(person.name); // Error: Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
// console.log(person.age); // Error: Property 'age' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
```

# Protected Members

Protected members are accessible within the class they are declared in and in subclasses.

```typescript
class Person {
  protected name: string;
  protected age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public greet(): void {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`
    );
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private jobTitle: string;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, jobTitle: string) {
    super(name, age);
    this.jobTitle = jobTitle;
  }

  public introduce(): void {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name}, I am ${this.age} years old, and I work as a ${this.jobTitle}.`
    );
  }
}

const employee = new Employee("Charlie", 35, "Developer");
employee.greet(); // Accessible, Output: Hello, my name is Charlie and I am 35 years old.
employee.introduce(); // Accessible, Output: Hello, my name is Charlie, I am 35 years old, and I work as a Developer.
// console.log(employee.name); // Error: Property 'name' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.
// console.log(employee.age); // Error: Property 'age' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.
```

# Summary

- **Public** members can be accessed from anywhere.
- **Private** members can only be accessed within the class they are declared in.
- **Protected** members can be accessed within the class they are declared in and in subclasses.

# Benefits of Using Access Modifiers

1. **Encapsulation**: Helps in encapsulating data, protecting the internal state of an object.
2. **Security**: Enhances security by restricting access to sensitive data and methods.
3. **Maintainability**: Improves code maintainability by defining clear interfaces for interacting with objects.
4. **Modularity**: Supports modularity by clearly defining the boundaries of each class.

# Guidelines for Using Access Modifiers

1. **Use Public for APIs**: Use public for methods and properties that need to be accessed from outside the class.
2. **Use Private for Internal Logic**: Use private for methods and properties that should not be exposed outside the class.
3. **Use Protected for Inheritance**: Use protected for methods and properties that should be accessible in subclasses but not from outside.
