# Minimize Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic complexity is a metric used to measure the complexity of a program by quantifying the number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code. It is used to gauge the complexity of a program and how difficult it is to understand, test, and maintain.

# Guidelines for Minimizing Cyclomatic Complexity:

1. **Decompose Functions**: Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.
2. **Avoid Deep Nesting:**: Limit the depth of nested control structures (if-else, loops) to improve readability and maintainability.
3. **Use Early Returns:**: Reduce the number of nested conditions by using early return statements.
4. **Leverage Polymorphism**: Use polymorphism to handle different conditions and reduce conditional logic.
5. **Refactor Complex Logic**: Extract complex conditions and logic into separate functions or modules.

# Benefits of Minimizing Cyclomatic Complexity:

1. **Improved Readability**: Simplified code is easier to read and understand, reducing the likelihood of errors.
2. **Easier Testing**: Lower complexity makes it easier to write unit tests and achieve better code coverage.
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Simplified code is easier to maintain and modify, facilitating quicker and safer changes.
4. **Increased Reliability**: Reduced complexity decreases the chances of bugs and makes the codebase more robust.

# Example 1

High cyclomatic complexity:

```javascript
function process(input) {
  if (input > 10) {
    if (input < 20) {
      if (input % 2 === 0) {
        return "A";
      } else {
        return "B";
      }
    } else {
      return "C";
    }
  } else {
    return "D";
  }
}
```

Minimized cyclomatic complexity:

```javascript
function process(input) {
  if (input <= 10) {
    return "D";
  }
  if (input >= 20) {
    return "C";
  }
  return input % 2 === 0 ? "A" : "B";
}
```

# Example 2

Using polymorphism to reduce complexity:

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    throw "This method should be overridden!";
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return "Bark";
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return "Meow";
  }
}

function getAnimalSound(animal) {
  return animal.speak();
}

const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

console.log(getAnimalSound(dog)); // "Bark"
console.log(getAnimalSound(cat)); // "Meow"
```
